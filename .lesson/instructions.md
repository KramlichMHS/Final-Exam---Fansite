# Final Exam - Fansite

**Directions:** Do you love model trains? Are you a die hard Harry Potter fan? Have you attended every Atlanta United game? Everyone is a fan of something! You will create a website that showcases something you are are a fan of. Before you begin creating your fansite, you must research what you would like to create and make a site map. Things to include on your site map: **Detailed notes on what will go on each page (minimum of 4 pages), how each page will look using the grid system ([need some help? check out these templates](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_templates.asp)), and a color scheme**. Your site map **must** be added to your files in repl as it will be a part of the rubric. [Here is a link to an example site map.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1MechgFl7zPMASYr-PtEBLwowefy34SSQu3fio-dNWHA/edit?usp=sharing)

Your website must contain at least 4 pages that are relative to your fansite. Your site must also be mobile responsive. **I will be resizing your site to see how it looks on a small screen as well as a large screen!** Other forms of CSS and Bootstrap usage including animations, transitions, glyphicons, page-headers, buttons, containers, tables and hover/active selectors will be needed to create a Professional Level website.
